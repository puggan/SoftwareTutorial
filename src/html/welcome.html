        <h1>Puggan's Software Developing Tutorial - Welcome</h1>
        <p>
            This tutorial's goal is to give knowledge about software development in any language.
            In each chapter you learn a new term or concept, first from a general point of view,
            and then an exemple of it is shown in multiple code-languages.
            After that is a summary of what is common, and what stands out, from the exemples.
        </p>
